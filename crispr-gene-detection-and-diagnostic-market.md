<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CRISPR Gene Detection and Diagnostic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cutting Function Detection Method</li><li>Positioning Function Detection Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CRISPR gene detection and diagnostic market comprises two main types: cutting function detection methods and positioning function detection methods. Cutting function detection involves utilizing CRISPR systems that can directly cleave DNA or RNA at specific sites, enabling precise identification of genetic material. In contrast, positioning function detection methods rely on the ability of CRISPR proteins to bind to specific sequences without cutting, allowing for the targeting and visualization of genes, facilitating diagnostics based on location rather than modification.</p></p>
