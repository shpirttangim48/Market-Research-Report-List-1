<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Conventional Lifeboat Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Lifeboat</li><li>Free Fall Lifeboat</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Conventional lifeboat market types include closed lifeboats and free-fall lifeboats. Closed lifeboats are fully enclosed, providing protection from harsh weather, and are designed for stability and safety during launch and recovery. They typically have a capacity for multiple passengers and utilize a davit system for deployment. In contrast, free-fall lifeboats are launched by free falling into the water from a height, allowing for rapid evacuation and reducing the risk of capsizing during launch. Both serve crucial roles in maritime safety.</p></p>
