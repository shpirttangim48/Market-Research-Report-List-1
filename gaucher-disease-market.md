<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gaucher Disease Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Enzyme Replacement Therapy</li><li>Substrate Reduction Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gaucher disease treatment markets primarily consist of two types: Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) and Substrate Reduction Therapy (SRT). ERT involves administering synthetic forms of the deficient enzyme, glucocerebrosidase, to alleviate symptoms by reducing harmful substrate accumulation. In contrast, SRT aims to decrease the production of glucocerebroside, the substrate causing the disorder, thus lowering its accumulation. Both therapies cater to the therapeutic needs of Gaucher disease patients, enhancing their quality of life and overall disease management.</p></p>
