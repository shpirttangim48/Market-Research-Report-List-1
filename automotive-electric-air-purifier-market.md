<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Electric Air Purifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Negative Electrical Charges Type</li><li>Positive Electrical Charges Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive electric air purifier market features two main types based on electrical charges: negative and positive electrical charges types. Negative electrical charge purifiers generate anions, which attach to pollutants, causing them to clump together and settle, effectively removing them from the air. Conversely, positive electrical charge purifiers produce cations that attract dust and allergens, promoting filtration. Both types aim to enhance in-car air quality, catering to consumer preferences for healthier, pollutant-free environments during travel.</p></p>
