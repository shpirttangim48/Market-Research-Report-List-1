<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Analog X-Ray Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Film Based</li><li>CR Film Cassette</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The analog X-ray equipment market is primarily divided into two types: film-based systems and CR (Computed Radiography) film cassettes. Film-based systems utilize traditional X-ray films to capture images, requiring processing in darkrooms. In contrast, CR film cassettes employ a photostimulable phosphor to capture X-ray images, which are later converted into digital formats using specialized readers. While film-based systems offer simplicity, CR cassettes enhance efficiency and image quality, bridging conventional radiography with modern digital advancements.</p></p>
